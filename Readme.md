# Expoll lib

This is the library repository for both the expoll [webclient](https://git.mt32.net/universum/expoll_client) and the [backend](https://git.mt32.net/universum/expoll_server) server.
Github equivalents: [webclient](https://github.com/Universumgames/expoll_client) and [backend](https://github.com/Universumgames/expoll_server)

This library contains all important definitions for objects, requests and responses for both server and client to easily communicate with each other.
